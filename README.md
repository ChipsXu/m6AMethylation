# The dynamic m(6)A methylation landscape of human tissues reveals insights into m(6)A function and regulation

## Abstract


  A single genome gives rise to a diversity of tissues through complex epigenomic
mechanisms, including N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), a widespread RNA
modification that has been implicated in many critical biological processes. However,
the global landscape of m(6)A in human tissues and its broad connection with human
development and common diseases remain largely elusive. Using m(6)A-sequencing,
we determined 21 whole-transcriptome m(6)A methylomes across major fetal tissues.
These data reveal a dynamic m(6)A methylation landscape of human tissues, identify
large numbers of tissue differential m(6)As, and particularly report m(6)A methylomes
of long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) in human tissues, of which the
lincRNAs derived from enhancers are enriched for m(6)As. Across these tissues, m(6)A
is positively correlated with expression homeostasis of its host gene. Importantly, tissue
m(6)A regions are often enriched for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with
expression quantitative traits and complex traits including common diseases, a number
of which potentially affect m(6)A modification directly. Lastly, we find m(6)As prefer
the genes with CpG-rich promoters and the promoter features regulate transcript m(6)A
methylation. Together, these data provide a valuable resource and indicate m(6)A is
widely regulated by human genetic variation and promoters, suggesting the broad
involvement of m(6)A in human development and diseases.
